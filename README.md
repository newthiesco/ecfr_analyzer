# ecfr-analyzer

Small web API to analyze the eCFR and estimate the size (in MB) of regulations per agency/title.

## What this project does
- Exposes `/api/agency-sizes` returning a JSON payload with agency names and estimated regulation sizes (MB).
- Caches results to disk and refreshes every 24 hours so the API reflects changes to the eCFR within 24 hours without changing source code.

## How it works (brief)
- The app scrapes the eCFR title/index page, follows candidate links for each title/agency, downloads a bounded number of pages per agency, and sums the bytes of responses to estimate size. This is a best-effort approach; if a bulk API is available you may substitute that code path for more exact results.
- Results are cached at `/tmp/ecfr_agency_size_cache.json` and rebuilt when older than 24 hours.

## Running locally
```bash
Make sure youâ€™re in the project directory

cd ecfr-analyzer
